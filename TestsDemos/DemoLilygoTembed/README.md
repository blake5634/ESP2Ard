#  Lilygo T-Embed Demo

This is a large project for ESP32 using the IDF toolchain.  Since it is big, we are just linking to 
it's own repo [HERE](https://github.com/blake5634/DemoESP2Ard_ESP32_tembed).

This project will let you set a time (HH:MM) using a rotary dial.  When you save the new time, it is sent
to an Arduino using ESP2Ard.
